Expected Outcomes
1.	What problem this project is trying to solve?
Problem	this	project	is	solving	Improve	speech-to-text	accuracy	in	noisy
environments. Reduce errors caused by similar-sounding words (homophones).

2.	Who are the beneficiaries?
Speech assistants, transcription services, accessibility tools, etc.

3.	How this is going to contribute for further development?
Combining	WAV2VAC	2.0	with	Transformers	for	improved	context-aware transcription.

4.	Scope for viability?
High, as AI-driven speech processing is in high demand.
